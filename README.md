## üé® Features

* **[`ngs convert`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/ngs/wiki/ngs-convert).** Convert between next-generation sequencing formats. 
* **[`ngs derive`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/ngs/wiki/ngs-derive).** Forensic analysis tool for next-generation sequencing data.
* **[`ngs generate`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/ngs/wiki/ngs-generate).** Generates a BAM file from a given reference genome.
* **[`ngs index`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/ngs/wiki/ngs-index).** Generates the index file to various next-generation sequencing files.
* **[`ngs list`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/ngs/wiki/ngs-list).** Utility to list various supported items in this command line tool.
* **[`ngs plot`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/ngs/wiki/ngs-plot).** Produces plots for data generated by `ngs qc`.
* **[`ngs qc`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/ngs/wiki/ngs-qc).** Generates quality control metrics for BAM files.
* **[`ngs view`](https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/ngs/wiki/ngs-view).** Views various next-generation sequencing files, sometimes with a query region.


## Guiding Principles

* **Modern, reliable foundation for everyday bioinformatics analysis‚Äîwritten in Rust.** `ngs` aims to package together a fairly comprehensive set of analysis tools and utilities for everyday work in bioinformatics. It is built with modern, multi-core systems in mind and written in Rust. Though we are not there today, we plan to work towards this goal in the future.
* **Runs on readily available hardware/software.** We aim for every subcommand within `ngs` to run within most computing environments without the need for special hardware or software. Practically, this means we've designed `ngs` to run in any UNIX-like environment that has at least four (4) cores and sixteen (16) GB of RAM. Often, tools will run with fewer resources. This design decision is important and sometimes means that `ngs` runs slower than it otherwise could.

## üìö Getting Started

### Installation

To install the latest released version, you can simply use `cargo`.

```bash
cargo install ngs
```

To install the latest version on `main`, you can use the following command.

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/stjude-rust-labs/ngs.git
```

### Using Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/stjude-rust-labs/ngs
docker run -it --rm --volume "$(pwd)":/data ghcr.io/stjude-rust-labs/ngs
```

`/data` is the working directory of the docker image. Running this command from the directory with your data will allow
the continer to act on those files.

Note: Currently the `latest` tag refers to the latest release of `ngs` and not the most recent code changes in this
repository.

## üñ•Ô∏è Development

To bootstrap a development environment, please use the following commands.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:stjude-rust-labs/ngs.git
cd ngs

# Run the command line tool using cargo.
cargo run -- -h
```

## üößÔ∏è Tests

```bash
# Run the project's tests.
cargo test

# Ensure the project doesn't have any linting warnings.
cargo clippy

# Ensure the project passes `cargo fmt`.
cargo fmt --check
```
